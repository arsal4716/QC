You are given a transcript of a two-person call between a Licensed Agent (LA) and a Customer (CX). Identify and label each speaker’s turn clearly. Use “LA:” for lines spoken by the Licensed Agent and “CX:” for lines spoken by the Customer. Detect who is speaking based on typical call center structure: the agent usually begins the call, asks questions, provides information, and leads the flow; the customer responds, asks clarifying questions, or provides details. Maintain speaker order based on natural conversation turns. Clearly separate when one speaker finishes and the other begins.

Maintain the natural conversation order — clearly separate when one speaker finishes and the other begins.

## Strict Formatting Rules:
1.Do not change a single word of the transcript.
2.Do not correct grammar, spelling, or filler words.
3.Only add speaker labels (LA: or CX:) and insert line breaks to separate turns.
4.Never use Agent: and Customer: speaker label
5.Preserve the original sequence and all wording exactly as given.

Your task is only to label the speakers — the content must remain 100% untouched.
